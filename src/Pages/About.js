                        <p>Hi! My name is Hannah Braswell! I am currently a sophomore at Clemson University pursuing a Bachelor’s Degree in Graphic Communications. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time as a student while learning and growing throughout my college career. I have always had an extreme passion for design from photography to architecture to graphic design. Growing up in a family who’s careers are design-oriented, I have been around the principles and aspects of design my entire life.  I understand the relationships between color, dimension and scale as it relates to graphic design. Being in the graphic communications department at Clemson has really expanded my knowledge and allowed my passion for design to grow even further.</p>
                        <p>My time as a student has allowed me to experience two full years of design-related courses. I have completed courses in graphic design processes, marketing, and web development. I am highly proficient in Adobe Softwares including Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, and Premiere. I have had deep experience in Adobe XD and After Effects.</p>
                        <p>While completing studies as a student, I have found my love for front end web development and user experience. Currently, I am proficient in HTML5 and CSS3 and plan to learn JavaScript. In the web development course I completed in Fall 2019, I was able to learn the code and software and eventually complete a website for a student client. Before this course, I did not really know what I wanted to do as my future career with my degree. While learning about web development, I realized that I loved the coding aspect of it because it required structure and analytical thinking, and I was able to use my knowledge and experience in graphic design to be creative when developing sites. </p>
